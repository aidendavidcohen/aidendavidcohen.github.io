# My persuasive writing

### I believe that everyone should have access to clean, fresh water and food.


> First of all, it is necessary for survival to have clean water and safe food. Lots of homeless people are forced to take the risk of drinking dirty water because its the only water they have. As a result of this, lots of homeless people get sick or die.
